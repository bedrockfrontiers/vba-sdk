# Debouncer (v1.3)

[Documentation](/docs/Debouncer)

## Overview

The **Debouncer** module is a highly specialized utility designed to manage and control the frequency of event-driven function executions within VBA environments. Debouncing is a critical technique for ensuring system stability and performance when handling noisy, rapid, or repetitive triggers, such as user inputs, hardware signals, or timer-based events.

## Purpose and Problem Addressed

In event-driven programming, certain events can fire repeatedly in quick succession (e.g., keystrokes, mouse clicks, or sensor signals). Executing an associated handler on every trigger can lead to:

- Excessive CPU utilization and degraded performance.
- Erroneous or redundant operations causing logical errors.
- UI flickering or degraded user experience.
- Unnecessary resource locking or contention.

The Debouncer module mitigates these issues by guaranteeing that the target function is invoked **only once after a configurable "quiet period"**, effectively filtering out superfluous calls.

## Core Technical Concepts

### Mechanism

At its essence, debouncing works by delaying the execution of a function or something process until a preset interval of inactivity is observed after the last event trigger. If a new event occurs within this interval, the timer resets, pushing back execution. This ensures that the action executes only once the event stream settles.

### Implementation Details

- **Timer-Based Scheduling:**  
  The module leverages VBA's `Application.OnTime` method or an equivalent scheduling approach to defer execution. This timer approach is non-blocking and lightweight, enabling the main thread to continue processing without interruption.

- **State Management:**  
  Internal flags and variables track whether a pending invocation exists. This allows the module to cancel or reschedule the pending call safely without race conditions or conflicts.

- **Dynamic Interval Handling:**  
  The debounce interval is configurable at runtime, allowing precise tuning depending on the event source characteristics or performance requirements.

- **Minimal Overhead:**  
  Unlike polling or busy-wait loops, the timer-driven approach avoids unnecessary CPU cycles, leading to optimal efficiency in VBA's single-threaded environment.

- **Robust Error Handling and Edge Cases:**  
  The implementation accounts for scenarios such as rapid bursts of events, system clock adjustments, or unexpected cancellations to maintain consistent behavior.

## Advantages Over Conventional Methods

- **Efficient Resource Utilization:**  
  By limiting function calls to strictly necessary instances, the module reduces unnecessary CPU workload and memory usage.

- **Improved Responsiveness and Stability:**  
  Prevents UI freeze or lag caused by flooding the event queue, ensuring smooth user interactions.

- **Scalable for Multiple Instances:**  
  Supports multiple independent debouncer objects, enabling simultaneous debouncing for different event sources without interference.

- **Simplified Integration:**  
  As a pure VBA solution without external dependencies, it seamlessly integrates into any Office VBA project, preserving portability and maintainability.

## Theoretical Foundations

Debouncing is a common pattern borrowed from hardware signal processing, where physical switches generate multiple transient signals ("bounces") when toggled. The software analog applies the same principle to mitigate spurious triggers from digital event streams.

Mathematically, debouncing can be viewed as a low-pass temporal filter on discrete event impulses, allowing only events separated by a minimum interval to propagate.

## Practical Considerations

- **Choice of Debounce Interval:**  
  Selecting the debounce interval is critical; too short can miss the noise filtering purpose, too long can introduce perceptible delays.

- **Limitations in VBA Environment:**  
  Due to VBA's single-threaded nature and reliance on `Application.OnTime` or `Sleep`, extremely tight debounce intervals (sub-100ms) may be less precise, depending on host application load and timer granularity.

- **Non-Reentrancy and Threading:**  
  The module is designed for single-threaded environments and does not support concurrent execution contexts.

## Summary

The **Debouncer** module embodies a robust, lightweight, and precise implementation of the debouncing technique tailored for VBA applications. It balances execution efficiency, configurability, and reliability, addressing a common pain point in event-driven VBA programming with a clean, modular design. This module is ideal for developers seeking to optimize event handling, enhance UI responsiveness, and reduce resource waste in Office macros and add-ins.
